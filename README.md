# Coding Around

This repository is filled with small projects made for learning purposes. Some will be just notes about some programming tool, programming language, library, etc... with some code examples. Others will be standalone projects made for fun. Every project will have a link to the learning resource used (udemy course, youtube video, blog post, etc.)

Have fun.
